As cannabis products grow in popularity and variety, there is increasing interest in using them in conjunction with an exercise program. As with any new topic, there are pros and cons involved with the concept. We’ve sorted out key aspects of each side of the conundrum to help you with your decision. Dr. G invites you to keep reading to learn more.

## First Things First

Any time you’re exploring a new subject, a bit of background information can go a very long way toward helping you through the proverbial learning curve. Thankfully, there are a few convenient tools available. First off, there is particular jargon associated with therapeutic cannabis, and if you’re unfamiliar, you can quickly get lost in the lingo. If it’s new territory, you might even want to dig through it before you go very far in your explorations.   

Lastly, there are three general products associated with cannabis and exercise. One is traditional marijuana, and the other two are THC and CBD products, which are products derived from extracts of cannabis and are typically used for therapy.  

## THC vs. CBD

There is often some confusion about the differences between THC and CBD. Both compounds are derived from cannabis and share similar chemistry, but they have significantly different effects on the body. THC has intoxicating effects, while CBD does not. That’s not to say it does not affect the mind and behaviors; on the contrary, some of the potential benefits of CBD, such as for [arthritis](https://www.euronews.com/green/2021/10/05/cbd-oil-miracle-cure-or-widespread-scam), stem from those effects, but it will not make you feel high.  

It’s also important to understand there is some belief that CBD products with trace amounts of THC might have stronger benefits than those without. It appears those trace amounts are enough to boost the body’s reception of CBD without a high sensation. 

## What Are the Benefits?

As Forbes explains, those who use cannabis products in association with exercise report a few [key benefits](https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilyprice/2019/04/30/marijuana-may-encourage-people-to-exercise-according-to-a-new-study/?sh=719653ce6ab2{}). It seems routinely using cannabis products can alleviate pain and inflammation, enhancing not only the workout itself, but also recovery time. Those are some of the same benefits people with arthritis appreciate.  

When combined with a positive, [stress-free environment](https://www.redfin.com/blog/clearing-bad-energy-from-your-home/), people who use cannabis also seem to be [inclined to work out more](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/article/supplements-articles/the-effect-of-weed-on-exercise/) frequently and for longer periods of time. They report enjoying the workout more, and in the long run, they are more inclined to stick with a fitness regimen. For those who struggle with finding motivation, who experience chronic discomfort, or who simply want to take their fitness program to the next level, using cannabis could be a good solution.

## What Does the Science Say?

It’s important to consider all sides of the equation, including your long-term health. With that in mind, here are some scientific findings worth considering:

- Brain health. Some [studies indicate](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323673) cannabis use could lead to reduced memory, lowered ability to learn, and altered metabolic patterns. On the other hand, there is hope cannabis might help reduce the effects of Alzheimer’s by reducing brain cell loss.  

- Lung health. There is research indicating that those who [smoke marijuana](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6118880/) can experience respiratory issues such as coughing, wheezing, and bronchitis. Those effects seem to resolve after discontinuing use. At this time, there is no indication that smoking marijuana raises the risk of developing lung cancer.  

- Heart health. As Healthline explains, cannabis products could potentially contribute to [heart damage](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/weed-wont-save-your-life-during-heart-attack#1). What’s more, it appears to raise the risk of stroke, coronary artery disease, and heart failure. [Edible cannabis products](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/marijuana-cannabis-edibles-health-issues) are causing particular concern, as they appear to raise users’ risk for severe heart problems.  

- Digestive health. Some studies indicate that cannabis offers therapeutic benefits to those with certain [digestive disorders](https://journals.lww.com/eurojgh/Abstract/2017/02000/Role_of_cannabis_in_digestive_disorders.2.aspx).

Is cannabis the answer to your workout woes? At this time, there is no clear answer. Weigh the pros and cons and research your options when deciding to add cannabis to your regimen.
